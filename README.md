Introduction
This simple project is entitled Real Estate Portal System. This is a simple web-based application that was developed using PHP/OOP and MySQL Database. This project is a simple website where can real state agents or brokers can publish the estate that they are handling. This allows them to publicize their estate along with some relevant information so that the site visitor has an idea for each estate published. This simple project has a pleasant user interface using Bootstrap Framework and AdminLTE Template. It has also user-friendly features and functionalities.

About the Real Estate Portal System
I developed this project using the following:

PHP
MySQL Database
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Bootstrap v5
AdminLTE
This Real Estate Portal System has 3 sides of the user interface which are the Admin Panel, Agent-Side, and Public-Side. The Admin Panel is the side of the system where the system management can manage the important information of the system and some of the dynamic content/data of the website. The Agent-Side is the part of the system where the registered agent can publish real estates that they are handling, list all added real estate, and manage the details. The real state data requires the agent to enter some relevant information including the map coordinates and some images. All the Available/Active real estate data will be visible to the public and visitors can read the estate information and get the broker or agent information.
